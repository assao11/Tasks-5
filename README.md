# Tasks-5
Used:
1-Arduino Uno R3 .
2-Red LED.
3- three Micro Servo .
4- Piezo .
5-Ultrasonic sensor .
6- 150 ohm Resistor .
7-Slide switch .
8- Temperature sensor .

I used 3 servo motors , one for the head and two for moving the arms: 
1- It automatically measures the surrounding distance and gives an alarm if objects approach a distance of 10 cm, within 3 seconds.
 2. I add temperature sensor It calculates the room when receiving the “temp” command via the serial port screen .
 3. He rotates to the right and left while moving the head when receiving the “right” or “left” command from the serial screen while moving the head in the direction of rotation to direct the sound wave sensor to another space.
